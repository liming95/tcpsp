What is it?
-----------

It implements TCP splicing for the Linux kernel. It can be used to
speed up layer-7 switching, web proxy and application firewall running
in the user space.

It is also a small software component of the Linux Virtual Server
project.

SETUP
-----

TCPSP currently requires that your system is running the Linux kernel
2.4.x.

To build and insert the ipvs modules, the commands can be as follows:
	# build the module
	cd <path-name>/tcpsp
	make

	# insmod the module
	su
	make install

	# set the debugging level
	echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/tcpsp/debug_level
	
	# list the splicing connections
	cat /proc/net/tcpsp_conn

	# run the very simple example shipped in the tar ball :)
	make -C example
	example/forwarder	# need to be root to run it currently
	lynx -dump localhost:8888

	# remove the module
	rmmod tcpsp
